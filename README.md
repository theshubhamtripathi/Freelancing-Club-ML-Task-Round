# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates data analysis and machine learning techniques on a cleaned dataset. The work is divided into two main tasks:
1. **K-Means Clustering and Statistical Analysis**
2. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Training and Imputation**

## Project Structure
- **`analysis.py`**: The main Python script containing all the code for the project.
- **`Task1_Visualization.pdf`**: Contains the visualizations for Task 1 (K-Means Clustering and statistical analysis).
- **`Task2_Visualization.pdf`**: Contains the visualizations for Task 2 (MLP training loss and actual vs predicted scatterplot).

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: K-Means Clustering and Statistical Analysis
- Perform clustering on numeric features of the dataset using K-Means.
- Evaluate clusters using the Silhouette Score.
- Visualize data distributions and clustering results.

### Task 2: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Imputation
- Handle missing values using KNN imputation.
- Train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor to predict target values.
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
- Visualize the training loss curve and prediction results.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. For Mac M1, it's recommended to use a version compatible with your architecture.

### Required Libraries
Install the required Python libraries using the command below:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
